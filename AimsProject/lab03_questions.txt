I prefer the method with arbitrary number of argument because i do not need to create an array object to store the dvds.

When we call the swap method, We are passing 2 references (or handles) that refer to 2 dvd objects. Java does not allow changing what object the handle refers to. That means if we try to change the object a handle refers to within the method, when that method is finished, the handle still refers to its original object. Therefore, the titles of the dvd remain unchanged after calling swap.

It changed because when we pass object reference to a method, Java does not allow changing what it refers to, but Java lets us perform allowed operation  on the object to which it is refering 
(changing the object's fields for example)
