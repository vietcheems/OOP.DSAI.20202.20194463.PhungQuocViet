1. Iterate through the list and print out the information of the media by using toString() method. Observe what happens and explain in detail.
The ouput is different for each type of media due to the fact the toString method is overrided from Media

2. If the passing object is not an instance of Media, what happens?
It returns false.

3. Suppose we are taking this Comparable interface approach.
a)What class should implement the Comparable interface?
class Media

b)In those classes, how should you implement the compareTo() method be to reflect the ordering that we want?
Use compareTo() to first compare the title of the two objects and compare the cost if it does not return 0

c)Can we have two ordering rules of the item  by title then cost and by cost then title) if we use this Comparable interface approach?
We cannot since compareTo() can only be overriden once.

d)Suppose the DVDs has a different ordering rule from the other media types, that is by title, then decreasing length, then cost. How would you modify your code to allow this?
Use instanceof to check whether the object is an instance of DVD in the compare() method of the 2 comparator, then change the way of comparing.
